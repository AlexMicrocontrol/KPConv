## Installation

A step-by-step installation guide for Ubuntu 16.04 is provided in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md). Windows is currently not supported as the code uses tensorflow custom operations.


## Experiments

We provide scripts for many experiments:

* Training on shape classification tasks (see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/HuguesTHOMAS/KPConv/blob/master/doc/object_classification_guide.md))
* Training on shape segmentation tasks (see [INSTALL.md](./doc/object_segmentation_guide.md))
* Training on scene segmentation datasets (see [INSTALL.md](./blob/master/doc/scene_segmentation_guide.md))
* Test of any of the models (see [TODO](./blob/master/doc/TODO.md)).
* Plot many values (time, loss, validation accuracies, etc.) for any training log (see [TODO](./blob/master/doc/TODO.md)).
* Visualization of learned features (see [TODO](./blob/master/doc/TODO.md)).
* Visualization of learned kernel deformations (see [TODO](./blob/master/doc/TODO.md)).
* Visualization of Effective Receptive Fields (see [TODO](./blob/master/doc/TODO.md)).

You will find more details on how to run these experiments and how to train a KPConv network on your own data in the [doc](./doc) folder
