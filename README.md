## Installation

A step-by-step installation guide for Ubuntu 16.04 is provided in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md). Windows is currently not supported as the code uses tensorflow custom operations.


## Experiments

We provide scripts for many experiments. The details on how to run these experiments in the [doc](./doc) folder.

#### Experiments instructions

* Training on shape classification tasks (see [object_classification_guide.md](./doc/object_classification_guide.md))
* Training on shape segmentation tasks (see [object_segmentation_guide.md](./doc/object_segmentation_guide.md))
* Training on scene segmentation datasets (see [scene_segmentation_guide.md](./doc/scene_segmentation_guide.md))
* Test of any of the models (see [TODO](./doc/TODO.md)).
* Plot many values (time, loss, validation accuracies, etc.) for any training log (see [TODO](./doc/TODO.md)).
* Visualization of learned features (see [TODO](./doc/TODO.md)).
* Visualization of learned kernel deformations (see [TODO](./doc/TODO.md)).
* Visualization of Effective Receptive Fields (see [TODO](./doc/TODO.md)).
* Train our network on your own data (see [TODO](./doc/TODO.md)).
